<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Subtractive Synthesis is produced by starting with waveforms and removing harmonics using filtering. Elements of this sythesizer includes a Reson Filter, Polyphony, Envelope Generation, and Filter Envolopes. The Reson Filter is made to emphasize a specific frequency by using a filter. Polyphony allows for multiple notes to be played at the same time. Envelope Generation is used to reduce note "popping", as well as managing note sustains. Filter Envolopes are used to filter parameters; an example of this can be used to replicate the "Moog" sound.</p>
<p>Supported Grading Components:</p>
<ul>
	<li>10 - Waveform playback from tables: Waveforms are played from tables.</li>
    <li>20 - Varying pitch playback from tables: Pitch can be varied to allow for different notes.</li>
    <li>30 - Envelope generation: Synthesis supports Envelope Generation.</li>
    <li>35 - Polyphony: Multiple notes can be played at the same time.</li>
    <li>40 - Reson implementation and the Moog sound: Synthesis supports a Reson Filter to replicate the Moog sound.</li>
    <li>50 - Filter envelopes: Synthesis supports Filter Envolopes</li>
</ul>
