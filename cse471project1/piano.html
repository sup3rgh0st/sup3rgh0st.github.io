<h1>Piano</h1>
<h2>Yaqueen Al-Marhoon</h2>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The PianoInstrumentFactory first reads the score files to set the effects indicated in it that the factory reads, and then creates a new PianoInstrument. The PianoInstrument is responsible for loading the note .wav sample, and applying the effects to the wave: if the pedal is pressed, it will play the full length of the sample, if it was not, it will change the duration of the sample to a more suitable shorter one. It also calls the Envelope function to implement the Attack-Decay-Sustain-Release effects. Finally, it sends this wave to WavePlayer to be generated. The specific note to be played, measure, beat, duration (in seconds), pedal-pressing effect, basic and advanced dynamic keys are all indicated in the .SCORE file.</p>
<p>Supported Grading Components:</p>
<ul>
	<li>10 - Plays piano notes: It plays piano notes correctly from a .SCORE file by playing .wav samples from the piano folder (the complete zip)</li>
    <li>20 - Envelope generation: It properly uses Attack-Decay-Sustain-Release envelope.</li>
    <li>30 - Pedal simulation: It supports the notes to play for their full duration without errors.</li>
    <li>35 - Basic dynamics: It properly determines the volume of a note based on how hard/long the key/pedal is pressed.</li>
    <li>40 - Pedal noise: It properly plays the .wav samples pedal noise from the piano folder when the pedal is pressed or released.</li>
    <li>50 - Advanced dynamics: It uses the Interpolate function to correctly interpolate the volume of the note.</li>
</ul>
