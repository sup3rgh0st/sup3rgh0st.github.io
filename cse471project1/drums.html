<h1>Drums</h1>
<h2>Patrick Jalilevand</h2>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The drum component combines several different drums with distinct sounds. There are a total of 20 different drum sounds, 19 that are loaded from a .wav file and 1 that was synthized by me using white noise, sweeping that white noise, and then running it through a reson filter. The Drums are the first part played in the .score, with all 19 drums being switched every 2 beats. In the second to last measure 3 drums (snare, triangle, bass) are all played at once. In the last measure I play my sythesized drum.</p>
<p>Supported Grading Components:</p>
<ul>
	<li>10 - Waveform playback from tables - The first 19 non-synthesized sounds are played back from tables.</li>
    <li>20 - Envelope generation - it properly uses attack and decay in order to avoid any "popping."</li>
    <li>30 - Polyphony - in the second to last measure of the drum playback I play 3 different instruments at once to show that polyphony is working.</li>
    <li>35 - Varying pitch playback from tables -several of the different sounds have different pitches.</li>
    <li>40 - At least 20 distinct drum sounds - yes there are 19 sounds that are played from .wav files and 1 synthesized drum.</li>
    <li>50 - Synthesized drum - the synthesized drum is played in the last measure of the drum part.</li>
</ul>
