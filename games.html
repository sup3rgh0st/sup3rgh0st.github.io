                        <p>In a far off land, a boy named Sully has a dream: Create the greatest city of all time. Control Sully as he explores an infinite, randomly generated world, collecting resources and recruiting villagers to help him on his journey.</p>
                        <p>For this game, I developed the interface for saving and loading assets as text files. Additionally, I wrote the character controller with its freely rotatable camera. The world's infinite terrain generation was a struggle, but I was able to isolate blocks of code into coroutines which greatly improved the game's performance.</p>

						<p>Cave Game was the first scrollable 2D game I've made, as well as the first game where I experiemented with random level generation. The player's goal is to collect a specified amount of fuel for their mining drill that is randomly scattered about the world. Platforms are generated in chunks on the fly when they are nearby offscreen. Each chunk remains in memory, so platform locations remain constant during the player's run.</p>

						<p>Drosera is a tile based tower defense game built for PC and Android featuring a unique powerup and energy system to sustain your towers.

This includes the tile based nature of the game, as well as writing a custom level importer that allowed designers to easily write waves of enemies without ever touching a single piece of code.</p>

						<p>Yozakura was a group project based on a prototype I had built hours prior. This game features a unique 2D locked side scrolling platformer in a 3D environment. The twist is that the 2D lock can shift in increments in the Z-Axis. While layer shifting, the player can only see one layer adjacent to them, which results in a unique puzzle environment that tests wit, skill, and memory. I wrote all of the code for this project.</p>

						<h3>2015 - 5 weeks</h3>

						<p>This game plays as a standard racing game with 2-Player and Time Trial Modes. As the main programmer in the team, I wrote the mechanics that drove the AI, the scripts that ensure you traversed the entire track length, cut scene code, multiplayer code, and more. The project itself looks a little rough around the edges, but the game's backbone is fully functional and could potentially be used in the future.</p>
