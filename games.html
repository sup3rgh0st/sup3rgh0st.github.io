                        <p>Spell Swipe was made as a senior design project at Michigan State Univeristy in collabortaion with Deep Silver Volition. Spell Swipe features the player drawing runes on their screen to cast powerful spells at waves of skeletons.</p>
                        <p>For this game, I wrote the robust shape recognition system that detects various patterns in a diamond shape. The shape is then encoded into an 8-bit number which is passed to the casting system. The Casting system, which I also wrote, handles monsters represented by 64-bit ulongs (8 * 8-Bit Runes). Bitwise operators are used for monster creation and damage, so it is very fast and resource friendly.</p>

                        <p>For Visionary, I was the sole programmer teamed with two talented 3D artists. In addition to the base game, I also wrote a custom online backbone that resembles "Jackbox Party Pack" branded games. All Visionary sessions are stored online in a mySQL database using PHP. Users can then submit guesses by navigating to Visionary's light-weight webclient and providing the simple 4 character lobby id which is shown on the builder's screen. The builder's client can then receive the guesses from the server, display them on screen, and check if a guess is a winner.</p>

                        <p>For this game, I developed the interface for saving and loading assets from custom text based files. Additionally, I wrote the character controller with its freely rotatable camera. The world's infinite terrain generation was a struggle, but I was able to isolate blocks of code into coroutines which greatly improved the game's performance.</p>

                        <p>Chroma Cannon is basic in design; you, the player, move around the field of play in an endurance test to survive as long as possible while racking up your high score. Each of the games supported platforms and versions utilize slightly different mechanics to take advantage of the technology that was available to me based on the platform. CC3 uses the touch screen and analogue stick from the Nintendo 3DS to move the player and direct their shoot direction. CC2 uses the multi-touch screen for movement, allowing the first finger to move and the second finger to shoot.</p>

						<p>Isotopolis is an exploratory game about the process of discovering rare isotopes.

Initially, the game was confusing for new players which provided a restrictive barrier to entry. We added fully voiced dialogue boxes explaining each step in detail, as well as modifying some steps to be more clear to the player. I also wrote a text to speech engine which speaks the name of the isotope name along with its atomic mass that the player creates.</p>
