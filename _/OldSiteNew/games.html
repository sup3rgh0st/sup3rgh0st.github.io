                	<p>The Chroma Cannon Anthology, as I like to call it, is a programming exercise where I program the same game into as many different mediums as possible. Chroma Cannon is basic in design; you the player move around the field of play in an endurance test to survive as long as possible. Each of the games supported platforms and versions utilize slightly different mechanics to take advantage of the technology that was available to me.</p>

                	<p>Cave Game was a fun game to build. Cave Game was the first scrollable 2D game I've made, as well as the first game where I experiemented with random level generation. The player's goal is to collect a specified amount of fuel for their mining drill that is randomly scattered about the world. Platforms are generated in chunks on the fly when they are nearby offscreen. Each chunk remains in memory, so platform locations remain constant during the player's run.</p>

                	<p>Kart Racing Game was my first team project. Under the team name "Triple Jump", five of us spent five weeks planning and developing a racing game. The game plays as a standard racing game with 2-Player and Time Trial Modes. As the main programmer in the team, I wrote the mechanics that drove the AI, the scripts that ensure you traversed the entire track length, cut scene code, multiplayer code, and more. The project itself looks a little rough around the edges, but the game's backbone is fully functional and could potentially be used in the future.</p>

                	<p>Yozakura was a group project based on a prototype I had built hours prior. This game features a unique 2D locked side scrolling platformer in a 3D environment. The twist is that the 2D lock can shift in increments in the Z-Axis. While layer shifting, the player can only see one layer adjacent to them, which results in a unique puzzle environment that tests wit, skill, and memory.</p>

                	<p>The most ambitious game yet, Gone Rogue is a fully random rogue like dungeon crawling game featuring three different themes for floors, each with their own unique boss. For this project, I handled all of the gameâ€™s random dungeon generation code, which was a lot of fun to write. On top of that, I also coded the level one and three (electric and fire) boss AI. We were lucky enough to have another strong coder on our team as well as a fantastic set of artists; this game is one of the few games that I am truly satisfied with, even with the occasional bug here or there.</p>
